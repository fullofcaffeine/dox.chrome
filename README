DOX.CHROME
==========
Chrome extension for searching haxe api documentation


ABOUT
-----
This extension integrates with the Chrome omnibox to bring haXe (http://haxe.org/) standard library API autocompletion right to your fingertips.
To use, type "hx", followed by a space or tab, followed by your query.
The first time you use the extension, there may be some delay, as the class index is retrieved and cached.
On subsequent uses, however, you should see instantaneous autocompletions.
Selecting a completion or fully typing a class name and then pressing enter will take you directly to the relevant documentation.
If a completion cannot be found, several search suggestions will be provided, including Google Codesearch, Stackoverflow and others.
